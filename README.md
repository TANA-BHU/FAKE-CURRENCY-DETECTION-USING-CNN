# Fake Note Detection using CNN

This project aims to detect counterfeit currency notes using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It uses a self-generated dataset of genuine and fake Indian currency notes of denominations ₹10,₹20,₹50 ₹200, ₹500, and ₹2000. The project is based on the paper Counterfeit Currency Detection using Deep Convolutional Neural Network by K. S. S. Prasad et al.
